To install, run FreqSetter-1.0.exe in Installer

FreqSetter.jar in jar has no effect since it needs admin permission, however I still put it there for reference, the app was made using jpackage and wix tools.

How to use:
This app was made to limit the maximum frequency of your cpu using powershell command, you can check the command I use in the source code. This app is kind of like worse alternative to undervolt. Since some laptop cpu cannot be undervolt, like mine, so it runs very hot and the cpu will throttling, setting lower frequency can help reduce the heat a bit, tho not much if you play heavy games or running cpu intensive applications, but definitely helps with light process and games. 

Type in the box as the MHz you want to limit, e.g. 3500 MHz = 3.5Ghz and press the button, remember to run the application as administrator.
